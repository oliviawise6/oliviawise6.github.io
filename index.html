    <h1>About Me!</h1>
    <div id="bio">
        <p> My name is Olivia Wise. I am currently a student at the university of Georgia. I am from Jacksonville, Florida and my major is communications studies. I enjoy painting, going to the beach with my two yellow labrador dogs, watching UGA football, and helping out in my local community. I am interested in public relations and want to pursue a career in this ever-changing industry. </p> 
        <p>This past summer, I interned in New York City at a boutique public relations firm specializing in lifestyle and fashion brands. I gained much from this experience, including the importance of brand messaging, marketing, and promotion. I plan to apply the skills I learned to my future endeavors in my life after college. I am interested in helping to build a brand and advancing their mission while also making an impact on the world. I have been very lucky to intern for some pretty incredible companies throughout the past couple of years.</p>

        <p>I am very passionate about helping out in my community. One of the organizations I am most passionate about is Feeding Northeast Florida. It is my local food bank in Jacksonville, Florida serving eight counties in my area. Volunteering with Feeding Northeast Florida allows me to play a role in the fight to end food insecurity. This organization has a tremendous impact on the community and continues to help many families who do not know where their next meal may come from. Some of the many ways that Feeding Northeast Florida enriches the community are:</p>
